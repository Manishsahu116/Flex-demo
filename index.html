            <h2>This is a cat.</h2><br>
            <p>The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as domestic cat or house cat, is a small domesticated carnivorous
                mammal. It is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology and genetics
                have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC.</p><br>

            <h2>This is a Dog.</h2><br>
            <p>The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it was domesticated from an extinct population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene, over 14,000 years ago by hunter-gatherers, prior to the development of agriculture.</p><br>

        <h2>Information</h2>
        <p>Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia (/ˌænɪˈmeɪliə/[4]). With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, have myocytes and are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Animals form a clade, meaning that they arose from a single common ancestor.
